            <p>In a shocking turn of events, top-ranked high school basketball recruit Koa Peat has announced his decommitment from the University of Arizona. The 5-star prospect, who had previously pledged his commitment to the Wildcats, is now reopening his recruitment, sending shockwaves through the college basketball world.</p>
            <p>Peat, a dominant force on both ends of the floor, had been a key addition to Arizona‚Äôs future roster. Many analysts projected him as a game-changer for the Wildcats, with his combination of athleticism, skill, and basketball IQ making him one of the most sought-after recruits in the country.</p>
            <p>Sources close to the situation indicate that Peat‚Äôs decision was influenced by multiple factors, including the possibility of exploring other programs that may offer a better system fit. Several schools, including powerhouse programs like Duke, Kentucky, and Kansas, are expected to reach out immediately to gauge his interest.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely surprising,‚Äù said one recruiting analyst. ‚ÄúArizona had been building around Peat as a cornerstone of their future. Now, with his decommitment, they‚Äôll need to reassess their plans moving forward.‚Äù</p>
            <p>While Peat himself has yet to make an official statement, speculation is already running wild about his next move. The McDonald‚Äôs All-American forward remains one of the most coveted prospects in the nation, and wherever he lands, he is expected to make an immediate impact at the college level.</p>
